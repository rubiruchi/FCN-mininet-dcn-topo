    Usage: sudo python fat_tree.py <K> <topology>

mininet/tree1024.py: contains code to bringup general tree topology. This python file keeps on creating topologies for hosts ranging from 2^k where k = {2 to 10}. As soon as you hit quit from CLI, the next 2^k topology is brought up for analysis. This is for OVS controller. The counterpart file mininet/tree1024_pox.py is for POX controller.
